1 Arm Hip Thrust,Exercise,Reps,,"Tips
•        As you push your hips up, also drive your knees away toward your feet, to keep the longest line possible through the spine.

•        At the bottom of the movement you should be looking forward between your knees and at the top you should be looking sideways (not up or down).

•        In the beginnerinnerinning, take your time in the top position to really feel the extension from hand to hand and from the top of your head to your knees. As you get intermediateermediateo the movement, you can then increase the speed and flow, but still try to keep that sense of really expanding at the top of each rep.

Breath 
•        Inhale down, exhale up. Use a light, controlled exhale to encourage stability through the torso.

1 Arm Plank,Exercise,Duration,,"Tips
•        Reach out with your fingertips to keep the longest line possible from your fingertips to your heels. 

•        Keep your weight over the pads of the second and third fingers, and actively push through your fingertips to avoid having too much pressure on the wrists.

•        Rather than thinking about contracting your abs, try to lengthen your spine and feel energy expanding out of your lower back.

•        Look down and just slightly in front of you (not forward) to keep length through the back of the neck

Breath 
•        Continue breathing throughout the plank. Use a light, controlled exhale to encourage stability through the torso.

1 Leg Alternating Push-Ups,Exercise,Reps,,"Tips•	Try to keep the body as still and quiet as possible as you switch legs on each rep.

1 Leg Bent Over Towel Row,Exercise,Reps,,"Tips
•        You can perform this with a towel, rolled up t-shirt, rope, or anything else that won’t be damaged by you trying to rip it in half. Because your main goal is to try to rip it in half the entire time.

•        As you descend intermediateermediateo position, drive the tailbone back to keep length in the lower back, and just allow the standing knee to bend to accommodate that movement.

•        Keep your chest wide and your shoulders relaxed down away from your ears.

•        You can use an overhand grip (palms down) to target the upper back or an underhand grip (palms up) to target more of the lower lats. Both are great options; I recommend trying them both.

Breath 
•        Inhale out, exhale in. Use a light, controlled exhale to encourage stability through the torso and to allow you to keep a constant pulling tension between the arms.

Butt Kicks,Exercise,Reps,,"Tips 
        •        The obvious focus of this exercise is on the quick movement of the legs and the heels hitting the hands behind your back. But be sure to also keep part of your focus on your feet as they touch the ground. The goal is to be as light and silent as possible each time your foot touches the ground.

        •        This exercise is fun to do fast! But be sure to never go faster than you can while keeping a long spine and relaxed jaw.

        •        Look straight ahead of you, not down, to keep your spine and neck lengthened.

Circular Push-Ups with Undulation,Exercise,Reps,,"Tips: 
	•	This exercise is rather technical at first, but it is also fun and should feel good! Focus on the sensation of the breath and movement more than the technical details. 

	•	If you haven’t tried Circular Push-Ups (without undulation) yet, be sure to check them out in the Exercise Library, as this more advancedancedanced variation is based on them, and is much easier to perform if you’re already comfortable with them. 

	•	You can beginnerinnerin these Push-Ups with just a slight bend in the elbows, in order to focus more on the undulation through the spine and swooping movement of the entire body. Then, after a few reps, bend the arms more and more to add more of a muscular challenge for the chest and triceps.

	•	Make sure that the head is moving the entire time, as well as the torso. Your gaze should also be moving in a perfect circle.

	•	Use momentum! As the body drops down to one side, really enjoy the momentum that comes from that swooping motion, and allow the energy from the drop to help swing the body back up on the other side. 

Breath: 
	•	Inhale as your release your torso down and to the side, and then exhale powerfully as you beginnerinnerin to push your torso back up the other side. 

	•	The inhalation will help expand the front of your body, and the exhalation will help contract the core to accentuate the curving of the spine as you push up.

Hand Crushers,"Exercise,warmup",Reps,,"Tips: 
	•	This is an excellent warm-up for the wrists before weight-bearing exercises such as Push-Ups or planks. If you’re using it as a warm-up, push past the burn just a bit, enough to get the blood really flowing and the muscles of the forearm activated, but not enough to get sore. If you’re looking to build forearm strength, you can continue to total failure and then repeat for multiple sets. In either case, it’s going to burn, so be sure to enjoy it!

	•	Open both hands as wide as possible and then close them as tightly as possible on each and every rep, no matter how fast you go.

	•	Start each set slowly, in order to ensure complete opening and closing of the hands, then increase the speed to find a fun and challenging flow.

	•	Keep your chest open and your shoulders relaxed down away from your ears the entire time. 

Breath: 
	•	Keep breathing as calmly as possible throughout the entire exercise, which will not be easy toward the end!

Hindu Push-Ups with Undulation,Exercise,Reps,,"Tips: 
	•	If you’re not yet comfortable with traditional Hindu Push-Ups, be sure to try them first, as this is an advancedancedanced variation of them.

	•	This exercise has an amazing flow once you get intermediateermediateo the groove, but it also requires a truly powerful contraction through all the anterior (front) muscles of the core in order to keep the undulation flowing smoothly through the spine. So don’t be shy – really go for it, both with the movement and your breath!  

	•	Allow your knees to bend and open to the sides as you move forward, to allow your head and torso to stay close to the ground.

	•	The undulation never ends in this movement, so there should never be any pointermediateermediate of stillness once you start moving.

Breath: 
	•	Inhale as you dive down and forward from Downward Facing Dog. Exhale as you push back toward Downward Facing Dog.

Hollow Body Holds with Extended Arms,Exercise,Duration,,"Tips: 
        •        This is an excellent exercise for training the specific combination of core engagement and shoulder flexibility necessary to perform a handstand. 

        •        Be sure to simultaneously reach back with your fingers and keep pushing them down toward the ground the entire time. Then you need to fight that downward push by engaging the abs to lift your shoulders and upper back off the ground. If it feels like that makes it harder to perform the exercise, you’re doing it right!

        •        Also reach with your toes, keeping your legs straight and as long as possible.

Breath: Use a strong controlled exhale to help engage the core as you first tuck the chin and lift your shoulders off the ground. Throughout the rest of the exercise, keep breathing continuously, using a shallow controlled breath to avoid any unnecessary movement in the core.

Lateral Push-Ups,Exercise,Reps,,"Tips: 
        •        From the bottom of each Push-Up, think about pushing yourself powerfully to the side, not up. If you try to push up and then sideways, the movement will feel heavy, but if you push sideways first, the momentum will help carry you from one side to the other with ease. 

        •        Keep your weight as light and quick as possible as you pass through the center at the end of each rep, which will help build more strength and power, and help prepare you for the more advancedancedanced variation, Plyometric Lateral Push-Ups.

        •        As you lower yourself down on each rep, allow your outside knee to open out to the side to make space for your entire body to arrive as close to the ground as possible without touching.

        •        One Push-Up is one rep, but it’s ideal to perform an even number of reps to work both sides of the body evenly.

Breath: 
        •        Exhale as you lower yourself down on on each side and beginnerinnerin to push back to the other side. Inhale actively as you pass through center.

	•	As you lower yourself down on each rep, allow your outside knee to open out to the side to make space for your entire body to arrive as close to the ground as possible without touching.
